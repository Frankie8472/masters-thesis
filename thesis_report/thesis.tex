First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor Clara Meister. Her constant support in the form of motivation, feedback, fresh ideas and explanations was an invaluable help and I appreciated it greatly. 
Secondly, I would like to thank Denise Spicher from the study administration. Her persistent moral and administrative support throughout my studies made ETH feel like home. 
I would also like to thank my supervising professor Ryan Cotterell for his valuable insights into my work. 
Furthermore, the continuous support from friends and family helped me stay on track over those six months. Thank you all for being there for me!

\begin{abstract}
This thesis introduces a new approach to analyzing language models with topic models. Specifically, we generate corpora from language models and then use topic models to analyze the language models via these corpora. This analysis reveals which areas of the semantic space language models used today are learning. We then compare the topic model distributions of the model-generated corpora with a topic model fitted to its training data---using a metric based on the Jensen-Shannon distance---to assess whether the innate topic distribution of a language model is a reflection of its training or a byproduct of its inductive biases. Through the variation of several factors, e.g. model architecture and generation strategy, we are able to gain a better understanding of the inductive biases of certain components that are part of the language modeling pipeline.
